# The EUC Wiki

Source code for the https://monowheel.wiki aka The EUC Wiki website.

As of now, you can only manually initialize a clean database using MediaWiki documentation,
which is cumbersome, but doable. I'm planning to make functionality for creating a 'test'
database, which will be derived directly from production data, but with all sensitive
information redacted (and some other tweaks).

Based on https://github.com/pastakhov/compose-mediawiki-ubuntu.git, thx man
